To build an MVP quickly, you need to leverage modern tech stacks and efficient development practices. Here are concrete steps to accelerate your MVP development:

1. Use rapid development frameworks: Choose frameworks designed for speed like Svelte, which offers near-zero runtime overhead and lightning-fast development. Svelte's compile-time approach means less boilerplate code and faster time-to-market compared to React or Vue.

2. Prioritize features with tech constraints in mind: Focus on features that can be built quickly with your chosen stack. For example, Svelte's built-in state management and transitions make it ideal for interactive UIs, so prioritize these types of features early.

3. Leverage modern development tools: Use tools that speed up development like:

   - SvelteKit for full-stack applications
   - Vite for fast build times
   - TailwindCSS for rapid styling

4. Test continuously with automated tools: Implement automated testing using tools like Playwright or Cypress from day one. This prevents bugs from slowing down development later.

5. Deploy early and often: Use platforms like Vercel or Netlify that integrate with your git workflow for continuous deployment. This keeps your MVP constantly available for feedback.

These concrete technical choices and practices will significantly accelerate your MVP development timeline. With modern tools like Svelte, you can have a working prototype in days rather than weeks.
Here's a simple example of a Svelte component that demonstrates these principles:

```svelte
<script>
  let count = $state(0);

  function increment() {
    count += 1;
  }
</script>

<button onclick={increment}>
  Clicks: {count}
</button>

<style>
  button {
    background: #4caf50;
    color: white;
    padding: 8px 16px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
</style>
```

This minimal component showcases Svelte's straightforward syntax and built-in reactivity, perfect for rapid MVP development.
